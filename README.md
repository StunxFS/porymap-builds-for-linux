# Porymap builds for Linux
Repository for Porymap map editor builds, for Linux.

I will try as much as possible to keep the builds up to date.

## How do I use Porymap?
>Before continuing, you are expected to have knowledge on how to use the Linux console.

First of all, we download the release in the Releases tab, then, using this command

`tar -xzvf nombre-del-release.tar.gz`

We extract all the content, now in the same terminal we write:

`./porymap`

This will cause the map editor to run.
Happy edition!
